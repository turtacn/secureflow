# secureflow

**Secure Multi-Party Data Intelligence and Collaboration Platform**

`secureflow` is an open-source platform designed to empower enterprises with privacy-preserving data intelligence and collaboration capabilities. It leverages cutting-edge technologies including Federated Learning (FL), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Confidential Computing (CC), and Blockchain to enable joint analysis and trusted data processing across organizations without exposing raw sensitive data.

## Client Pain Points & Value Proposition

In today's data-driven world, organizations face significant challenges:

* **Data Silos & Privacy Concerns:** Valuable data often remains siloed within individual organizations due to privacy regulations (like GDPR, CCPA) and concerns about exposing sensitive customer information or commercial secrets. This hinders collaborative data analysis that could unlock immense business value in areas like industry alliances, supply chain finance, and joint marketing.
* **Security of Cloud Processing:** While cloud platforms offer scalability and advanced analytics tools, enterprises are wary of processing their sensitive data on external platforms, fearing potential access by cloud providers or other third parties, even during computation.
* **Lack of Data Science Expertise & Tooling:** Many organizations lack the specialized data science teams and sophisticated tools required to transform their vast data troves into actionable insights and informed business decisions.

**`secureflow` addresses these pain points by providing:**

* **Privacy-Preserving Data Collaboration:**
    * Utilizes Federated Learning to keep raw data localized, exchanging only model parameters or gradients.
    * Employs Multi-Party Computation (e.g., encrypted aggregation, homomorphic encryption) for joint statistical analysis and model training, ensuring data remains encrypted throughout the computation process.
* **Trusted Data Processing with Confidential Computing:**
    * Enables data processing tasks to run within hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX or AMD SEV, ensuring that even platform administrators cannot access plaintext data during computation.
    * Offers pre-configured confidential container images and runtimes, allowing clients to verify the trustworthiness of the computing environment.
* **Integrated Data Intelligence Tools:**
    * Provides a low-code/no-code visual interface for data cleaning, labeling, feature engineering, and model training, simplifying the MLOps lifecycle.
    * Offers pre-built model templates for common industry use cases (e.g., supply chain risk, joint marketing recommendations, industry forecasting) that can be trained collaboratively using federated learning.

## Key Features

* **Trusted Data Collaboration Spaces:** Create "data nodes," define fine-grained data access policies, and invite partners for specific joint analysis or model training purposes.
* **Comprehensive Privacy Computing:**
    * **Federated Learning:** Out-of-the-box support for PyTorch-FL/TensorFlow-FL, supporting both Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL) and Vertical Federated Learning (VFL).
    * **Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Pre-integrated tools (e.g., MP-SPDZ, MPyC adapters) for encrypted aggregation and privacy-preserving statistics. Support for homomorphic encryption libraries.
* **Visual Data Processing & AI Modeling:**
    * Low-code interface for data import (CSV, Parquet, DB connect), preview, cleaning, and feature engineering, executable locally or in cloud-based confidential environments.
    * Built-in industry model templates (e.g., supply chain finance risk scoring, joint marketing recommendation, sales forecasting).
    * Graphical reporting and visualization of results, exportable to PPT/PDF.
* **Compliance, Auditability & Traceability:**
    * All data operations, model training, and inference requests are recorded as encrypted logs on a blockchain ledger for immutable traceability.
    * One-click generation of audit reports detailing participants, timestamps, data fields used, training outcomes, and revenue sharing.
* **Automated Revenue Sharing & Value Exchange:**
    * Smart contracts to record contributions (data volume, training duration) from collaborating parties and automatically calculate revenue distribution for jointly created value (e.g., a more accurate risk model).
    * Support for tokenization or a points system for internal settlements or external value exchange.

## Architecture Overview

`secureflow` employs a hybrid architecture:

* **Local Nodes:** Deployed within enterprise premises or private clouds, responsible for raw data storage, preprocessing, and local model training.
* **Cloud Coordination Center:** Runs in a trusted confidential computing environment (e.g., Kubernetes with SGX/SEV worker nodes). It manages federated learning parameter exchange, secure aggregation, job scheduling, and hosts the platform's core services.
* **Blockchain Network:** A lightweight permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Quorum) provides an immutable audit trail and facilitates automated revenue sharing via smart contracts.

Communication between local nodes and the coordination center is secured using TLS and mutual authentication. Federated learning processes incorporate differential privacy mechanisms (like DP-SGD) to protect gradient information.

For a detailed architecture, please see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Build and Run Guide

*(This section will be updated as the project develops. The general approach is outlined below.)*

**Prerequisites:**

* Go (version 1.20.2 or later)
* Docker & Docker Compose (for running dependencies and confidential containers)
